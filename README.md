# Coop-Koala - Won Best College Themed Hack at Revolution UC 2016
Shows the timeline of a daily life of a co-op/intern. Current co-ops can enter their daily life through an online form and then other students can see it to know more about that coop and company. 

## Inspiration
Inspired by the layout of sites like [Facebook] (https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/timeline-now-available-worldwide/10150408488962131/) to show content in a chronological timeline form which is visually informative and relevant. 

## What it does
Shows the timeline of a daily life of a co-op/intern. Current co-ops can enter their daily life through an online form and then other students can see it to know more about that coop and company.

## How I built it
Built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Frameworks were used to rapidly prototype the development process. 
List of frameworks used:
- [getmdl.io] (https://getmdl.io/)
- [animate.css] (https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)
- [jQuery] (https://jquery.com/)
## Challenges I ran into and what I learned
Making the timeline cards and positioning elements provided a good practice for CSS positioning which is generally a bit tricky. Having fundamentals of CSS positioning cleared was also useful when I started to implement Bootstrap framework.
## What's next
Adding a login form for both current coops/interns and students to save their favorite jobs and compare them with other jobs.
## What I learned
More web dev concepts. Team planning. 
## What's next for CoopKoala
Make it more campus specific and enable employers/current coops to register and enter their timeline.
